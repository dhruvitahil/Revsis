      "comment": "Shorter version: Awful methods of teaching. Some professors are good, others are just PITA. Next to no-one cares about learning, everyone is looking for ways to get more marks and for that they will do anything to accomplish it. E.g. writing 50-100 page journals, which includes nothing but copied stuff from books/old journals.\n\nFull:\n75% attendance is compulsory! 90% of the time lectures are pure garbage and still you have to go to college and attend, what an awful waste of time. 90% professors thing we are some kinda empty buckets and they are filling us with their factual knowledge. The thing they don't understand  is not everyone is same. I never needed lectures, I could study on my own with books and internet resources. But nearly 7-8 hours of my day were being wasted behind college, which I could've used to pursuit my other hobbies.\n\nExamination style is wet poop. Final tests include 7*2=14 questions in total. Most of them are just for checking you memory. You gotta remember facts to ace examinations. No one cares about understanding of concepts. Ever heard about job interview where they ask you complicated formulas? They don't! Cause it makes no sense to remember them, when you can easily derive them or use a book/internet in real life. But you gotta remember them at SBMP! \n\nIn-plant training is good. You get to have experience in real industry for ~1 year. But they grade it on the basis of report you make, which they DON'T READ!\n\nI guess, I can't tell if this one is worst, cause I don't have experience with other colleges in India.\n\nMy advise: Stay away from this college, and if you find similar reviews about other colleges, stay away from higher education altogether. It's awful waste of time, YOLO!",

And not to forget the different streams for selection  (Civil Engineering Mechanical Engineering Electrical Engineering Industrial Electronics Plastic Engineering Chemical Engineering Digital Electronics Computer Engineering Information Technology) that this college has.\n\nBeing a pass out from the computer engineering department the faculty is really great. Each of the faculty who is teaching you has an extensive knowledge and experience about the subject. Not only that but the Practical knowledge that you get from here will really help you for your degree as well as higher studies. The faculties are really helpful and are really approachable and friendly anytime you have some doubt.\n\nComing to the Infrastructure the college has only recently been shifted to the new building and the new infrastructure is simply wonderful. The labs are all equipped with the latest in tech desktops and the WiFi facility provided throughout the college is pretty fast and reliable. The labs are well maintained and even the lab assistants and technicians are really helpful.\n\nAll in all this is the best college as far as diploma is concerned with highly experienced and helpful faculties friendly staff and the best infrastructure a college can have. \n\nAnd not to forget a special thanks to all the Computer Engineering department Faculties for being so wonderful."
